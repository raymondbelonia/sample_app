# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

I plan on adding modifications to the original sample application.  The proposed modifications are:

Messaging Function
Search Feature
Password Reset Form

So far these are the only ones I can think of.
